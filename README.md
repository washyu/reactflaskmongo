This is based on the flask react project by [Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/author/Miguel%20Grinberg).
You can find the tutorial [tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-create-a-react--flask-project) that I followed here.

I added a Mongodb to the docker-compose.yaml.  I wanted to use this as a base for a copy of personal projects.
